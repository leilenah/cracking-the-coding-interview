### Logarithmic
O(log N)

[Logarithm Review](http://www.mclph.umn.edu/mathrefresh/logs.html)
- a logarithm is the power to whcih a number must be raised in order to get some other number
- "log" written without a subscript refers to a base ten log
- **Example 1: Base Ten Logarithm**
    - the base ten logarithm of 100 is 2
    - log 100 = 2 (because 10<sup>2</sup> = 100)
    - the base unit is the number being raised to a power
- **Example 2: Base Two Logarithm**
    - The base two logarithm of eight is three
    - log<sub>2</sub> 8 = 3 (because 2<sup>3</sup> = 8)
